# Information-service

## Fronted configuration for local developement

First you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

Once Node is ready you can now install project dependencies and run the server. Open website directory in terminal and then follow these steps:
1. npm install - needed to install dependencies locally, you need to do this step only when it's your first time running frontend on your machine or if something changed in file website/package.json
2. npm run dev - this command spins up server hosting website, output of the command will have the address and port that you can use access the website

To shut down the server simply use CTRL+C hotkey or close terminal.
